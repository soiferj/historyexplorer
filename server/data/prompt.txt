Given the following historical event title and date, write a concise historical event description (max 3 sentences) and suggest 3-7 relevant tags (keywords, array of strings). The tags should include the broader context of the event, such as a war if the event was a battle, or the empire if the event was an event in the empire. The tags should be unified as much as possible. For example, "Mongols" should be used in place of two separate tags of "Mongol Empire" and "Mongol History". Avoid having overly generic tags like year and unspecific words like "colonialism" or "empire".

Title: {{title}}
Year: {{year}}

Respond in JSON with keys 'description' and 'tags'. For example:

{
    "description": "description of historical event",
    "tags": [
        "tag1",
        "tag2",
        "tag3"
    ]
}
