Given the following historical event title and date, take the following actions:

1. write a concise historical event description (max 3 sentences). The tags should include the broader context of the event, such as a war if the event was a battle, or the empire if the event was an event in the empire. The tags should be unified as much as possible since they will be used for filtering on the UX. For example, "Mongols" should be used as a more generic term in place of "Mongol History" or "Mongol Expansion". Do not include overly generic tags like year, century and unspecific single words like "colonialism" or "empire".
2. suggest 3-7 relevant tags (keywords, array of strings).
3. assign a list of 1-5 broad regions (array of strings, lowercase, e.g. ["europe"], ["scandinavia", "europe"], ["middle east"], ["east asia"], ["africa"], ["central asia"], ["north america"], ["south america"], ["central america"], ["south asia"], ["oceania"], etc.) where the event primarily took place. The regions should be as coarse-grained as possible and always chosen from a small set of broad world regions suitable for filtering and grouping on a map/timeline. If a region has a direction in it, always use "north", "south", "east", "west" instead of "northern", "southern", "eastern", and "western".
4. assign a list of 1-5 modern-day countries (array of strings, lowercase, e.g. ["france"], ["germany", "france"], ["china"], ["united states"], etc.) that best correspond to the event location. The countries should be modern-day countries, not historical ones.
